# Crop Prediction Model

This project is a machine learning-based web application that predicts the most suitable crop to grow based on soil and environmental conditions. The model is built using a Random Forest Classifier and is trained on a dataset of various crops and their growth conditions.

## Overview

This project uses the `RandomForestClassifier` from the `sklearn` library to predict crops based on factors such as:
- Nitrogen
- Phosphorus
- Potassium
- Temperature
- Humidity
- pH level
- Rainfall

The trained model is deployed in a web application using Flask, allowing users to input soil conditions and environmental data to receive crop recommendations.

## Features

- Machine learning model trained on crop data.
- Flask-based web application with a user-friendly interface.
- Predicts the best crop based on user input.
- Displays a confusion matrix heatmap to evaluate model performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `Crop_recommendation.csv`, which includes features such as:
- N (Nitrogen in soil)
- P (Phosphorus in soil)
- K (Potassium in soil)
- Temperature
- Humidity
- pH level
- Rainfall

The target variable is the type of crop that grows best under those conditions.

## Model

The model used in this project is a `RandomForestClassifier`. The key steps involved in training the model are:

1. Data preprocessing: Standardization of the input features.
2. Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. Training the `RandomForestClassifier` on the training data.
4. Evaluating the model on the test data.

The model achieved an accuracy of **99.3%**.

## Web Application

The web application allows users to input the following values:
- Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium ratios
- Temperature in Celsius
- Humidity percentage
- pH level (0-14 scale)
- Rainfall in millimeters

Based on this input, the application predicts the most suitable crop.
