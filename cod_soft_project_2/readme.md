# IMDb Movie Ratings Prediction

Welcome to the IMDb Movie Ratings Prediction project! In this project, we leverage data science techniques to predict IMDb movie ratings based on various attributes such as release year, duration, genre, director, and cast. This README provides an overview of the project, its contents, and instructions for usage.

## Introduction

This project aims to explore and analyze a dataset containing information about Indian movies sourced from IMDb. We employ data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning techniques to build a predictive model for IMDb movie ratings.

## Project Structure

The project repository contains the following files:

- `IMDb_Movie_Ratings_Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data preprocessing, analysis, modeling, and prediction.
- `IMDb Movies India.csv`: Dataset containing information about Indian movies sourced from IMDb.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for usage.
- `LICENSE`: License information for the project.

## Dependencies

To run the code in the Jupyter Notebook, you'll need the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `plotly`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install these dependencies via pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly scikit-learn
## Usage

1. **Clone the repository to your local machine:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/imdb-movie-ratings-prediction.git

Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd imdb-movie-ratings-prediction
Open and run the Jupyter Notebook IMDb_Movie_Ratings_Prediction.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
Follow along with the code in the notebook to explore the dataset, preprocess the data, build the predictive model, and predict IMDb ratings for new movies.
