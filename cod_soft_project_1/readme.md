# Titanic Survival Prediction

Welcome to the Titanic Survival Prediction project! In this project, we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and build a machine learning model to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. This README provides an overview of the project, its contents, and instructions for usage.

## Introduction

This project analyzes the Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including details such as their age, gender, class, and survival status. We aim to explore the data, visualize important insights, and build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of a passenger surviving the Titanic disaster.

## Project Structure

The project repository contains the following files:

- `titanic_survival_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and machine learning model building.
- `Titanic-Dataset.csv`: Dataset containing information about passengers aboard the Titanic.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for usage.
- `LICENSE`: License information for the project.

## Dependencies

To run the code in the Jupyter Notebook, you'll need the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `plotly`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install these dependencies via pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly scikit-learn
```
## Usage

1. **Clone the repository to your local machine:**
bash
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-survival-prediction.git
```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
bash
```
cd titanic-survival-prediction
```
3. **Open and run the Jupyter Notebook Cod_Soft_task_2.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.**
Follow along with the code in the notebook to explore the dataset, preprocess the data, visualize insights, build the predictive model, and make predictions.
