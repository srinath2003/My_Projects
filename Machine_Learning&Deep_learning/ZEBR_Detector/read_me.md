## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <github-repo-link>
   cd <github-repo-directory>
   
2. **Open the Cloned directory**
     Before Training the model and inferencing with .pt file ,and clone the yolo8 series from the official site or from the github. Use GPU for faster training.

## Dataset 
   Use the below link for data set .
      [link text](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ayushv322/animal-classification/data)

## Training
   Use the Main_.ipynb file  to train the yolo model , commonly yolo uses pytorch architecture , so make the cuda environment to run the pytorch.
## Test
   Use the best.pt for prediction , elephant_project_live_camera.ipynb file runs the model with live inbuilt camera , if the inference confidence are above .80 the model label the object in the live feed.
